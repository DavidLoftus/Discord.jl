# Discord.jl

Discord.jl is the solution for creating [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bots with the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org).

## Why Julia/Discord.jl?

* Strong, expressive type system: No fast-and-loose JSON objects here.
* Non-blocking: API calls return immediately and can be awaited when necessary.
* Simple: Multiple dispatch allows for a small, elegant core API.
* Fast: Julia is fast like C but still easy like Python.
* `TODO`: More reasons

For usage examples, see the [`examples/` directory](https://github.com/PurgePJ/Discord.jl/tree/master/examples).
